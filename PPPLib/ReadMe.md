The following library is an extract of classes used by the NovacPPP and the purpose of
extracting them from the main PPPExe project is to be abel to run unit-tests on them.

This library also contains replacement classes for making the migration
from using the MFC classes to standard C++ easier for the different Novac software.
These classes are located in the MFC folder.
