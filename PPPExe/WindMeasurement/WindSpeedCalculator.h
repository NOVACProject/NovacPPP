			of column variations using the correlation between the two 
			data series. The idea being that the two time series have been
			measured in such a way that one of them measured on a more up-wind
			position along the plume than the other one. Assuming a certain
			altitude of the plume, the speed of the plume can be calculated
			by calculating the temporal delay between the two time series. */
